You edit slides in both PT-BR and EN HTML files for this presentation project.

## Rules

- Always update BOTH `ai/claude-code/claude-code-open-source.html` (PT-BR) and `ai/claude-code/claude-code-open-source-en.html` (EN)
- After any change, verify sections are balanced: `<section>` count must equal `</section>` count
- `preventDefault` must remain intact: exactly **7 occurrences** per slide file
- Update ALL `goTo(N)` in the agenda to match new slide indices
- Never use `replace_all` on words that appear in JavaScript
- Never modify CNAME or LICENSE
- Run fix-accentuation after modifying PT-BR content
- After adding, removing, or reordering slides, run update-prd to sync docs/PRD.md
