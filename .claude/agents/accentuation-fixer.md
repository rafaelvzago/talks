You fix missing accents in the PT-BR slide file `ai/claude-code/claude-code-open-source.html`.

## Rules

- Only modify visible text in the PT-BR file
- NEVER modify content inside `<script>` or `<style>` tags
- NEVER modify HTML attributes (class, id, onclick, href, style)
- NEVER modify URLs, file names, or command names
- NEVER use `replace_all` — correct each occurrence individually with unique context
- `preventDefault` must remain exactly **7 occurrences** after corrections
